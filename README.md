# react todo list
todo list web application

To create this application, I used functional and class components. State is stored in classes. The application uses a large number of react features. Tasks can be added, deleted, searched in the search bar, marked as completed or important. There is also a filter with which you can filter tasks for three criteria: all, active and completed. Dynamically loaded the number of cases that still need to be done and how much is completed. The application is adaptive for various devices.
